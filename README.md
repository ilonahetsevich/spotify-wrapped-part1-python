<h1>Spotify Wrapped: A Deep Dive Into 8 Years of Data
  <br />
Part 1. Retrieving Data From Spotify Using Python and Spotify API
</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>

<p>When Spotify Wrapped didnâ€™t quite meet my expectations this year, I decided to create my own version! This project is all about retrieving and exploring my Spotify listening habits using Python and the Spotify API. There is a second part of this project interely focused on data analysis using SQL.</p>
<br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Requesting My Listening Data</b>
<br />
<p>Spotify allows users to request their historical listening data. I submitted my request through the Spotify Privacy Page. After a few days, I received severalJSON files containing my listening history, along with a helpful "Read Me First" guide that explained the structure of the data.</p>
<br />
- <b>Setting Up Spotify Developer Access</b>
<br />
<p>To go further, I needed to connect to Spotify's API to access the genre data which was not available in the json files provided.  I headed over to the Spotify Developers Page to create a developer account and enerate a Client ID and Client Secret for API authentication.</p>
<br />
<p>With these initial steps completed, I was ready to move on to data retrieval and exploration.</p>
